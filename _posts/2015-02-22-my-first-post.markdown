Checking out how to use Jekyll to make a first post via `_github pages`.

I think i will need to use some responsive jekyll boilerplate that some good soul has created with a nice theme. I will have to search to get a good theme... which will come later. 

Currently, my focus is on learning [Meteor][meteor]. I am creating a [meteor boilerplate][meteor-boiler] that I can use to create fully-fledged meteor applications quickly. The goal is to have a fully functional application as soon as you fork the repo. I will add more documentation as the work progresses...

So, this whole Jekyll blog thing has got me hooked. I have been searching for how others are doing it and if there are any good solutions for non techies to do this:

- [Octopress][octopress] looks like a tool, but a lot of people seem to hate it. Did not dig deeper into it...
- [shiori][shiori] looks like a minimalist theme
- [solo][solo] looks even more minimalistic

I am hoping to keep adding posts & slowly update the design of this blog to suit my needs.
